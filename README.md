# Tipper

A simple **tipping calculator**. It lets the user enter their original bill amount and give them the choice to choose the percentage of the bill amount they would like to give as the tip.It also takes the input of the number of people in total that split the bill and displays the tip amount each person would give and the total bill amount of each person.

This has a minimalist design of a calculator done using CSS and HTML.
